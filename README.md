1. INTRODUCTION:

        This project is a Rule-Based Chatbot developed using Python programming language. The chatbot communicates with users through text and responds based on predefined rules and keywords. It is designed as a student internship project to understand the basics of chatbot development.

2. OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:

        The main objectives of this project are:
               To understand the working of chatbots
               To learn basic text preprocessing
               To implement rule-based logic using Python
               To develop an interactive console application

3. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:
           Programming Language: Python
           Module Used: re (Regular Expressions)

4. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
